    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",

Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

       "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant content based on the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input to a generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or knowledge that can help it produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, often a transformer-based model like GPT, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The presence of relevant information from the retrieval step helps the model generate more informed and precise outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate text based on specific, up-to-date, or domain-specific information that may not be fully captured in the model's pre-trained parameters. It is commonly used in applications like question answering, customer support, and content creation.\""

      "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models, particularly those using natural language processing (NLP). This involves creating inputs that help AI systems understand tasks and generate accurate responses. It is used with generative AI models, such as large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini. The goal is to optimize the interaction with these models to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. Techniques in prompt engineering include few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and iterative refinement, among others. It is a critical skill in the age of AI, empowering users to extract the most value from these powerful models.\n",

As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 became more complex, prompt engineering evolved to meet the demands of these advanced systems. The field has seen significant developments, including the introduction of reinforcement learning techniques in 2017, which enhanced the controllability and adaptability of language models.

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative artificial intelligence models by integrating information retrieval capabilities. It allows models to respond to user queries by referencing a specified set of documents, augmenting the information drawn from their vast, static training data. RAG was introduced by researchers from Facebook AI (now Meta AI) in 2020, as detailed in their paper \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.\" This approach marked a significant shift in AI systems, enabling them to access and leverage a broader range of external knowledge, thus improving the quality and reliability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs).\n",

This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to train a model for a specific task, as the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of transfer learning techniques, especially in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. In NLP, the introduction of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 popularized the concept of fine-tuning. BERT and similar models are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n",
