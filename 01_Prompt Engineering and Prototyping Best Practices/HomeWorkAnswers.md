   ![first](Default1.png)

   Aspect Tested:
   1. Ability to correctly respond the asked question.
   2. How informative is the answer.
   3. Creativeness of the answer.
   4. How natural does the response sound.
   5. Accuracy of the answer.

   Vibe Check:<br/> 
        ChatBot App responsded correctly to the asked query and provided a simpler explanation as if answering to a beginner (as it was asked in the query). When I tried to re-run the query, the LLM responded with different but relevant answer so it does pass the creativeness check and answers do sound natural too. In the few test runs, the responses did clear all the aspects being tested and hence the LLM would pass the vibe check.
    

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶ <br/>

   Aspect Tested:
   1. Ability to identify and summarize the main ideas.
   2. Ability to maintain the original meaning while condensing the information.
   3. Relevance of the summary to the original text.
   4. Presentation of the response should be clear and easy to understand.
   
   Vibe Check:<br/>
        The chatBot app was able to identify and summarize the main idea, it maintained the original meaning while effectively condensing the information.The summary was relevant to the original text and effectively captured the key points without losing the essence of the information presented. Though chatbot was successful in providing a clear and concise summary of the key points, the information presentation wasn't good and hence it fails the vibe check on the last point.


3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

   Aspect Tested:
   1. Ability to create a compelling narrative while demonstrating creativity and originality.
   2. Story length should be within the range asked in the query.
   3. Story should be relevant to the theme asked in the query.
   4. Creativeness of the response.

   Vibe Check:<br/>
        The chatBot app successfully responded with a short narrative that captured the essence of finding friendship and connection. The story was both relevant and also within the limit asked in the query but after running the query multiple times, the LLM responses seems repeatitive with just changing the animal name while keeping the robot name and concept same. LLM clearly lacked the creativeness and also originatlity in subsequent runs, thus failing the vibe check.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

   3. Providing correct thought process and reasoning behind the answer.
   4. Able to repeat the answer on multiple tries.

   Vibe Check: <br/>
        Chatbot App's response clearly shows that its being to correctly solve the math problem and also provide the correct thought process and reasoning behind the solution. It generated same response on multiple tries. This passes the vibe check on all points.

        The chatbot demonstrated a proficient ability to transform the provided text into a polished and formal style, ensuring that the original meaning was preserved throughout the revision process. It also provided good formating, making it look professional and ready to be copy pasted into an official email/document. The chat bot passes the vibe check.



##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool? <br/>

>Some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool include its subjective nature, as it relies on personal perceptions and feelings rather than objective metrics. Accuracy and creativeness can be correctly evaluated only after running through many samples and not just few manual tests. This can lead to inconsistent results, depending on who's doing the checking and what mood they're in. It might also unfairly penalize people who have unique communication styles.
Basically vibe checking might give us a general feel but its not the most reliable way to assess an LLM's performance
